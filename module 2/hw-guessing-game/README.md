## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.neu.edu` to complete and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is a consistent architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Note: Your code **must** compile and run on the Khoury machines. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* Note: You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* And do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!
