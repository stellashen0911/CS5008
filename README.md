## CS5008
 This is a repository for the CS5008 Data Structures, Algorithms, and their Applications in Computer Systems course Spring 2022 at the Northeatern University

#Objective
This course presents an integrated approach to the study of data structures, algorithms, and their applications within computer systems. We introduce a variety of systems-related topics (models of computation, computer architecture, compilation, system software) and fundamental techniques for solving algorithms (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, graph algorithms) as they apply to computer systems. The integration of topics is demonstrated through the implementation of fundamental data structures (lists, queues, trees, maps, graphs) in the C programming language. Additional breadth topics can include programming applications that expose students to primitives of different subsystems such as multi-threading.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

1. Navigate the operating system using a terminal
2. Compile, debug, and execute source code
3. Describe each step of the compilation process
4. Write, compile, link, and run C programs
5. Implement common data structures in C
6. Write programs with dynamically allocated memory in the C language
7. Describe how hardware is used on software to improve performance
8. Describe the difference between a process and a thread
9. Analyze and state the complexity of common sorting and search algorithms.
10. Describe specific algorithmic strategies and how each can be used to solve algorithmic problems.
11. Implement and use common graph representation structures and trees.
12. Implement common graph traversal and search algorithms.
13. Solve recurrences by substitution method and using the master theorem in order to prove an algorithmâ€™s asymptotic complexity.
14. Design trade-offs given a set of algorithms and data structures regarding their time and space complexity.
